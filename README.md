# ü§ñ AI-Powered Trading Strategy Explorer

This project is a complete end-to-end AI-based trading strategy evaluator built using Python and Streamlit.  
It allows users to analyse stock or crypto tickers and compare an ML-driven trading strategy vs the actual market performance.

## üì¶ Features

- ‚úÖ Live data download (e.g., BTC-USD, AAPL, ETH-USD)
- üìà Technical indicators added as features
- üß† Machine learning model ensemble (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- üéØ Signal prediction with adjustable confidence threshold
- üíπ Backtesting: strategy vs market performance
- üìä Performance metrics table (Sharpe Ratio, Volatility, Win Rate, Return)
- üß† Layman-friendly UI with clear explanations

---

## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Clone the repo** or upload files to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
3. Type in a ticker (e.g. `BTC-USD`) and press "Analyze"
4. Adjust the confidence threshold slider to control signal sensitivity

## üìò Strategy Logic

- The app trains an ensemble ML model to predict whether the price will increase > 0.5% in the next 3 bars.
- A trading **signal = 1** is generated if the model is confident above the selected threshold.
- Returns are calculated by applying these signals with one-bar delay (`signal.shift(1)`).
- Strategy performance is compared with simply holding the asset.

## ü§ñ How the Strategy Works

This strategy uses **machine learning** to decide when to buy an asset ‚Äî based purely on patterns in past data.

### üîç Step-by-Step:

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - We create technical indicators like RSI, EMA, momentum, volatility, etc.
   - These give the model clues about market behavior.

2. **Target Definition**
   - The model learns to predict: _‚ÄúWill the price rise > 0.5% in the next 3 bars?‚Äù_
   - We label past data accordingly: `1` for a rise, `0` otherwise.

3. **Training ML Models**
   - We use a mix of models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
   - The top 3 performers are combined into a VotingClassifier ensemble (like a team of advisors).

4. **Generating Buy Signals**
   - When the model is confident (e.g., 60%+), it issues a **buy signal**.
   - You can adjust the confidence threshold to be more/less aggressive.

5. **Backtesting**
   - We simulate how this strategy would have performed historically.
   - It‚Äôs compared with simply holding the asset, showing both on a cumulative return graph.

### üìà Why Use This?
- Avoids buying during uncertain times
- Can reduce drawdowns (loss periods)
- Adapts to new patterns over time via retraining

The result: a **data-driven, rule-based strategy** that reacts to real market signals ‚Äî not gut feelings.
